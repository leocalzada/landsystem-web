               research questions, due to the complex relationships between the
               ecological nature of the invasion and the human responses to the
               invasion. This paper focuses on the linkages between an invasion
               of bracken fern and land use decisions in an agricultural
               frontier in southern Mexico. Agriculture in this region is
               practiced on an extensive basis, using traditional slash-and-burn
               techniques of temporary cultivation and continuous rotation
               through forest fallow. We investigate the factors that affect the
               decision of a subsistence farmer to either continue cultivating
               an invaded agricultural plot or permanently abandon the plot and
               cultivate elsewhere. We develop an agricultural household model
               of land use choices, where households maximize utility subject to
               constraints on land, labor, and income. We subsequently test the
               hypotheses raised, using data from a small household survey
               performed in the region in 2002.",

               by land surface attributes, specifically including the types of
               vegetation, topography and human structures, which makes it
               difficult to characterize land cover as discrete classes. One of
               the challenges in characterizing a land‐cover type is to
               distinguish variability within the class from actual land‐cover
               transformation. The spread of plant invasions in tropical systems
               is affected by seasonal variations and disturbances such as
               agricultural activities and fires, making it difficult to
               determine the spread through thematic classifications. In this
               paper, we estimate the changes in spatial extent and seasonal
               variation of bracken fern invasion in Southern Yucatán from 1989
               to 2005 by using a linear mixture model (LMM), a widely used
               method in the classification of remotely sensed data. The results
               show an increase in areas affected by bracken from 40 km2 in 1989
               to almost 80 km2 in 2000. Lower estimates of the invasion
               resulted from data acquired at the end of the dry season
               (March–May), when bracken mixes with secondary vegetation or is
               removed by fires. The accuracy of the maps is estimated through
               the use of sketch maps of farmer's parcels and field data
               collected from 2000 to 2001. Understanding the spatial
               distribution and annual variability of bracken fern cover in the
               region is critical to determining the relation between
               disturbances such as fire and forest recovery. Using LMM may
               enhance this understanding by giving a more accurate picture of
               the extent and distribution of bracken fern invasion.Abstract in

               species‐level responses to severe winds are limited in this

               August 2007) on dry tropical forests across the southern Yucatán
               was examined with respect to tree damage, mortality, and
               sprouting. Damage was assessed 9–11 mo following the hurricane in
               92 (500 m2) plots stratified by wind speed and normalized
               difference vegetation index (NDVI) change classes over a 25,000
               km2 study area. We investigated the relative importance of biotic
               (i.e., species, size, and wood density) and abiotic (i.e., wind
               speed) factors to better explain patterns of damage. Overall
               mortality was low (3.9\%), however, mortality of less common
               species (8.5\%) was elevated more than fourfold above that of 28
               common species (1.8\%), indicating immediate selective
               consequences for community composition. Species varied in the
               degree and type of damage experienced, with susceptibility
               increasing with tree diameter and height. Wood density influenced
               damage patterns only in areas where a critical threshold in storm
               intensity was exceeded (wind speeds ≥210 km/h). Although overall,
               damage severity increased with wind speed, common coastal species
               were more resistant to damage than species distributed farther
               inland. Our findings suggest that selective pressure exerted by
               frequent hurricane disturbance has, and will, continue to impact
               the floristic composition of forests on the Yucatán Peninsula,
               favoring certain wind‐resistant species.Abstract in Spanish is

               forests heighten the need for integrated assessments of
               deforestation processes and for models that address the
               fine-tuned location of change. As Mexico’s last tropical forest
               frontier, the southern Yucatán peninsular region witnesses these
               tensions, giving rise to a “hot spot” of tropical deforestation.
               These forests register the imprint of ancient Maya uses and
               selective logging in the recent past, but significant modern
               conversion of them for agriculture began in the 1960s.
               Subsequently, as much as 10\% of the region’s forests have been
               disturbed anthropogenically. The precise rates of conversion and
               length of successional growth in both upland and wetland forests
               are tied to policy and political economic conditions. Pressures
               on upland forests are exacerbated by the development of
               infrastructure for El Mundo Maya, an archaeological and
               ecological activity predicated on forest maintenance, and by
               increased subsistence and market cultivation, including lands on
               the edge of Mexico’s largest tropical forest biosphere reserve.
               In this complex setting, the southern Yucatán peninsular region

               biomass-derived energy will be essential in order to limit carbon
               emissions from the world’s energy sector in the future. The IPCC
               envisions as much as 400 million ha being devoted to biomass
               energy plantations by 2050. To realize production of biomass
               energy at such levels — in a manner that would be both
               biogeophysically sustainable and socially beneficial — will
               require planning and policy development at sub-national levels,
               taking into account biogeophysical, social, cultural, economic,
               institutional, and other factors. This paper presents a method
               for spatially explicit calculations for estimating potential
               biomass yields over relatively large geographic regions. The
               calculations use geo-referenced data inputs that include
               rainfall, insolation, temperature, soil quality, and soil depth.
               The methodology is applied to the Northeast region of Brazil,
               which accounts for 10\% of the area of South America. Northeast
               Brazil is an interesting site for illustrative purposes in part
               because it is biologically, geologically, and socio-economically
               diverse and in part because the main electric utility serving the
               region is exploring the development of biomass-based electricity
               generation to meet future increases in electricity demand.
               Results from a spatially explicit, biogeophysical model like that
               presented here could be combined with other spatially explicit
               information such as road layouts, existing land uses, population
               densities and growth rates, distributions of endangered species,
               archeologically significant areas, etc. to inform planning and
               policy development related to biomass energy at a regional or
               national level. One illustration of such an analysis is included
               here. For on-the-ground implementation of biomass production
               systems, finer-resolution analysis and intimate local
               participation is essential.",

               to severe environmental problems such as eutrophication, ground
               water depletion and loss of wildlife. The objective of this paper
               is to model deforestation between 1971, 1985 and 1991 in the
               watershed of the Ipswich River in Massachusetts, USA, where most
               of the forest loss is attributable to new residential
               development. The maps of suitability for deforestation are
               calibrated with maps of real change between 1971 and 1985 by
               using logistic regression, multi-criteria analysis and spatial
               filters. The maps of 1971 and 1985 serve also as the basis to
               extrapolate the quantity of predicted future deforestation. Then,
               the calibrated suitability maps and extrapolated quantities
               predict the location of deforestation between 1985 and 1991. The
               predicted deforestation maps are validated with the map of real
               forest loss of 1985–1991. relative operating characteristic (ROC)
               and variations of the Kappa index of agreement (Kno, Klocation
               and Kquantity) measure the validation. For most simulation runs,
               Kno=93\%, Klocation=8\% and Kquantity=100\%. The best predictor
               of quantity of deforestation from 1985 to 1991 is linear
               extrapolation forward in time of the deforestation that occurred
               from 1971 to 1985. It is difficult to predict the exact locations
               of deforestation in the watershed because only 2\% of the
               watershed is deforested from 1971 to 1991, the patches of
               deforestation are scattered evenly across the landscape, and the
               some of the most important variables are not readily available in
               digital form. Nevertheless, the best predictor of location of
               deforestation (ROC=70\%) is a suitability map that uses a spatial
               filter and multi-criteria evaluation of elevation, slope, and
               proximity to existing residential areas. The locations that are
               most threatened are those that are unprotected, near existing

               increases in yields and declines in cropland occurred
               infrequently, both globally and nationally. Agricultural
               intensification was not generally accompanied by decline or

               policymakers contending with the degrading effects of forest loss

               forest transitions? The historical record over the last two

               The early transitions often occurred passively, through the
               spontaneous regeneration of trees on abandoned agricultural
               lands. Later forest transitions occurred more frequently after
               large-scale crisis narratives emerged and spurred governments to
               take action, often by planting trees on degraded, sloped lands.
               To a greater degree than their predecessors, latecomer forest
               transitions exhibit centralized loci of power, leaders with
               clearly articulated goals, and rapid changes in forest cover.

               high-resolution optical RS data and traditional field inventory
               to estimate carbon stocks in silvopastoral systems. We compare
               field data in the Macas region of the Ecuadorian Amazon with
               high-resolution RS data. Aboveground estimates of carbon were
               calculated using the field data. Tree cover was obtained through
               segmentation analysis of RS data. Results show 45\% of the area
               in the study region is covered by trees and the rest is either
               pasture or areas cleared for new pastures. Field data shows a
               statistically significant positive correlation with percentage
               canopy cover estimated by segmentation analysis (R = 0.52),
               compared to a lower correlation with RS measures of NDVI (R =
               0.11). In this study the amount of carbon stored in aboveground
               biomass ranges from 20 T/ha to 28 T/ha. The study shows how to
               estimate landscape variability in carbon storage, moving up in
               scale from ecological transects to farms.",

               Silvopastoral systems may increase carbon pools in pastures while
               maintaining productivity. Adding trees to pasture provides carbon
               sinks in woody biomass, and may improve degraded soils and
               increase the stability of soil carbon pools. In this study we
               quantified the biomass carbon stored in spontaneous silvopastoral
               systems in southeastern Ecuador. We compared the stem density,
               basal area, aboveground biomass, and organic carbon in the top 20
               cm of soil in 100 pastures, ranging from 3 to 250 hectares, in
               four different communities. Aboveground live woody biomass,
               calculated using allometric equations and two different wood
               densities, varied from 10.99 to 66.1 Mg per hectare. Soil organic
               carbon pools ranged from 85.0 to 97.6 Mg per hectare. Stem
               density, basal area, and aboveground live biomass all positively
               correlated with pasture age. We found no relationship between
               pasture age or stem density and soil organic carbon pools. We
               measured live woody biomass carbon pools of 34?1070 Mg of carbon
               per farm in these silvopastoral systems. We found no effects on
               productivity of the herbaceous layer, suggesting that having a
               low density of trees in pastures could substantially increase the
               number of trees and the associated carbon sequestration without
               affecting cattle production.",
